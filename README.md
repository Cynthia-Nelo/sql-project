# SQL Movie Database Project
## Overview
This project involved working with a movie dataset to deepen my understanding of SQL and database management. I utilized both basic and advanced SQL features to effectively query and manipulate the data.

## Skills Practiced
### Basic SQL Queries
Data Retrieval: Used `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` statements to query and filter data.

### Advanced SQL Features
**Joins:** Implemented various types of joins (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`) to combine data from multiple tables.

**Partitioning:** Used partitioning techniques to organize data for improved performance in complex queries.

**Aggregation:** Applied aggregate functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` to summarize data.
### Database Updates
Executed `UPDATE` statements to modify existing records, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
### Dataset Information
The dataset consists of a collection of movies, with attributes including:

* Title
* Genre
* Release Year
* Rating
* Director
* Box Office Earnings
* Sample Queries
* Here are some examples of SQL queries I implemented during the project:

## Conclusion
This project has significantly enhanced my understanding of both basic and advanced SQL techniques. I now feel confident in my ability to query, update, and manage relational databases effectively.

## Future Work
I plan to explore more advanced topics, such as stored procedures, triggers, and performance optimization techniques, to further expand my SQL expertise.
